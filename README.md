### Google OAuth2 Integration for Development

This guide provides steps to integrate **Google OAuth2** using **Google Developers Playground** for development purposes.

### Steps:

1. **Navigate to Google Developers Playground:**
   - Visit the [Google Developers Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/).

2. **Add OAuth Scopes and Authorize APIs:**
   - In the first step, add the following OAuth scopes (all in one line) and click "Authorize APIs":
     ```
     https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile
     ```

3. **Exchange Authorization Code for Tokens:**
   - In the second step, click "Exchange authorization code for tokens."
   - Copy the `id_token` from the response.

4. **Send `id_token` to Your API Endpoint:**
   - Send a `POST` request to your API endpoint (`api/login/google/`) with the `id_token` in the request body as JSON.
     ```json
     {
       "token": "<your_id_token_here>"
     }
     ```

5. **Receive and Use JWT Token:**
   - You will receive a JWT token in the response.
   - Use this JWT token for authenticated requests by adding it to the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
     ```
